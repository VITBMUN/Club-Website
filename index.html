        <h2>What is Model United Nations?</h2>
        <p>During a Model UN conference, students take on the roles of representatives for a country, organization, or individual,
        collaborating with delegates globally to address and solve various issues. MUN not only imparts skills such as research,
        public speaking, debating, and writing but also fosters critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities.
        Formulating solutions agreeable to a majority of representatives also cultivates negotiation, conflict resolution, and
        cooperation skills. </p>
